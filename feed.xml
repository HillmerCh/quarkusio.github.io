                Failures are inevitable. There is nothing we can do about that, and that also applies to Kafka applications. Your application may contain a faulty component misbehaving once in a while, or unable to process a specific Kafka record. In this post, we are going to see how we can manage...

                Though Quarkus offers extensions for MicroProfile, including metrics, we&#8217;re now recommending the use of the Micrometer extension for metrics in Quarkus with the release of 1.9. Brief MicroProfile Metrics History During the creation of the MicroProfile Metrics specification in 2017, Dropwizard Metrics was the most popular metrics library at that...

                Last week, David, a Quarkus user, asked me about retrying an asynchronous operation. David has a picky remote HTTP service, which sometimes misbehaves. Easy answer! Just do: uni.onFailure().retry().atMost(x). But, David is curious, and asked me a second question: how does retry work? Well, thatâ€™s simple; it just retries&#8230;&#8203; As you...

                Last week we became aware that the OpenJDK team in Java 15 have disabled biased locking (JEP 374) in the Java virtual machine. This is a change from previous versions and could potentially have a negative impact on Java application&#8217;s performance. Red Hat&#8217;s own performance teams are currently running performance...

                This week, I&#8217;ve been asked about a widespread use case around concurrency. This user wanted to call two microservices in parallel, and when both results are received, join them and continue the processing. Basically, the following pattern: In a non-reactive approach, both calls would block the caller thread, and, except...
