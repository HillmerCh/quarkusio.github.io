                In a previous blog post, we have looked at failure strategies provided by the Reactive Messaging Kafka connector. But, imagine it&#8217;s our lucky day, and for once it worked. We should inform Kafka that the processing succeeded. In Kafka terminology, we call this: offset commit. This post covers the different...

                Intro When I&#8217;ve been introduced to Quarkus, back in December 2018, I suddenly had the feeling the Quarkus runtime has the potential of covering ~95% of the software use-cases. My friend Sanne demoed Quarkus on his laptop when the runtime was still in an alpha state, far from being the...

                Reactive Programming offers an elegant, flexible, and powerful way to write asynchronous code. It supports failure handling, both sequential and parallel operation composition, and plenty of operators. Reactive programming promotes data streams as a primary construct, and your code is observing streams and reacting to signals. Figure 1. Origins of...

                Failures are inevitable. There is nothing we can do about that, and that also applies to Kafka applications. Your application may contain a faulty component misbehaving once in a while, or unable to process a specific Kafka record. In this post, we are going to see how we can manage...

                Though Quarkus offers extensions for MicroProfile, including metrics, we&#8217;re now recommending the use of the Micrometer extension for metrics in Quarkus with the release of 1.9.

                Last week, David, a Quarkus user, asked me about retrying an asynchronous operation. David has a picky remote HTTP service, which sometimes misbehaves. Easy answer! Just do: uni.onFailure().retry().atMost(x). But, David is curious, and asked me a second question: how does retry work? Well, thatâ€™s simple; it just retries&#8230;&#8203; As you...
